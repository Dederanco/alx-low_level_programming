A readme on C - Functions, nested loops                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                
0. Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.                                                                
1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game.                        
2. Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.                                    
3.Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.                                                                        
4. Write a function that prints the sign of a number. (Prototype: int print_sign(int n); Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater 
than zero; Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero; Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero).                                
5. Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer. (Prototype: int _abs(int); FYI: The standard library provide
s a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.                                                                           
6. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number. (Prototype: int print_last_digit(int); Returns the value of the last
 digit.                                                                                                                         
7. Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59. (Prototype: void jack_bauer
(void);You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)                                                                        
8. Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0. (Prototype: void times_table(void)                          
9. Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result. (Prototype: int add(int, int);)                              
10. Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line (Prototype: void print_to_98(int n); N
umbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space; Numbers should be printed in order; The first printed number should be the number passed to your function; The last printed number should be 98; You are allowed to use the standard library)
